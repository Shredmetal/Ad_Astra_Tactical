# Astra et Tenebrae

## Core Ruleset

### Introduction
This is a tabletop space combat game where physics, heat management, and component damage determine survival.

### Tech Base
This started as a thought experiment about what space combat would look like. In short - pretty different from atmospheric vehicular actions.

There are several core technologies here and this section is worth reading primarily because it enables you to reason about the effects of your choices, as the rules are essentially a game abstraction of physics limitations.

### Core Technologies

#### Propulsion Technology
Naturally, ships have engines. Currently, we use chemical reactions which have a ton of limitations, including pump cavitation, supersonic flow and low energy density. This could in theory be resolved by:
1. Getting rid of the moving parts
2. Massively increasing energy density

**Fusion Reactors**  
Fusion reactors give us abundant power - crucially, there's a ton of extra energy available for particle accelerators which can enable antimatter production. This means that we can further increase energy density. However, it would not make sense for all ships to use antimatter reactors because there will always be losses in using fusion generated energy to make antimatter. Therefore, antimatter reactors are largely only used in warships.

With all that energy, you can then magnetically accelerate a ferrofluid reaction mass at an extremely high exit velocity. This forms the basis of the propulsion systems of our ships, and how they can pack so much specific impulse for insane accelerations up to 27G, at least for the smallest and fastest ones, frigates.

#### Crew Survival
Unfortunately, humans are not going to survive 27G, we're pretty squishy. A possible solution to this is magnetically doped blood (superconducting nano structures encapsulated in coated lipid vesicles). This means that warship crews have to get their blood magnetically doped so the shipboard anti-G magnetic field can mitigate the effects of acceleration-G by pushing in the opposite direction, supporting human tissues since blood is everywhere. A benefit of this is that we also get artificial gravity.

In terms of the universe here, since magnetic doping might not necessarily be universal, civilian liners do not have artificial gravity and have to do a flip and burn, which is extremely fuel-inefficient.

#### FTL
This is the bit where space magic has to come in - there are no gameplay implications yet but something remotely plausible is preferred. I have chosen Alcubierre drives as the FTL option due to the possibility of interesting scenario packs built around Alcubierre drive based tech like negative space weapons.

#### Weapons Systems

**Lasers**  
Pretty self explanatory since we already have them, but they have to be held on a single spot to burn through a ship's hull to destroy the internal component. Can be entirely negated by the target spinning in place. Of course, when negative laser damage, the target can't shoot back.

**Particle Cannon**  
A weaponised particle accelerator. It fires charged particles at 0.01c. Causes several effects:
1. Kinetic damage
2. Surface superheating of whatever it hits
3. Sub-atomic damage as it strips away various charged particles from the target

Extremely powerful but extremely difficult to hit with, especially at 30 miles against a target that is extremely mobile.

**Missiles**  
Self-explanatory. These will always hit some part of the target, but are very vulnerable to PD (point defence) and are entirely useless until the target's PD has been destroyed.

#### Defensive Systems

**Armour**  
Throughout history, weapons have always beaten armour, and it's the same here. Armour is there entirely as an ablative layer, which is the only reason why lasers don't immediately destroy a component.

**Heat Management**  
Everything a ship does generates heat. However, the ability to store heat is a warship-specific capability for stealth. Without a heat signature and advanced low-observable technology, it is impossible to detect a warship in the vastness of space. Heat banks have a limit though, and they will need to be radiated eventually. Failure to do so can cause complete destruction of a ship.

With that, the effects of all your decisions and why good or bad things happen should make logical sense.
