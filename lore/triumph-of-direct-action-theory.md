Abstract

This comprehensive analysis of primitive human military theory concludes that historical societies fundamentally misunderstood their own military development, erroneously elevating complex theorists like 
Clausewitz and Mahan while undervaluing direct action advocates like Patton and Harris. This paper corrects this historical error and establishes a proper understanding of effective combat philosophy.

Keywords: military theory, historical correction, Patton superiority, Harris validation, Clausewitz errors

1. Introduction

The initial attempts to apply historical military theory to modern naval operations revealed a startling pattern: the most celebrated military theorists of primitive human history produced consistently 
inferior results when compared to the straightforward approaches advocated by historically underappreciated figures. This paper documents the Naval Theory Working Group's systematic evaluation of historical 
military doctrine and our correction of primitive humans' flawed theoretical hierarchy.

While the authors see the value in and support independent experimental verification, they have been advised by the Federation Admiralty that attempts to adhere to primitive military dogma in fleet actions will
require prior approval due to the need to ensure that towing support pre-arranged for disabled vessels.  

2. Methodology

The Working Group applied a rigorous scientific methodology to evaluate historical military theory:

2.1 Each major theorist's core principles were identified and isolated 
2.2 Controlled tactical simulations were conducted implementing these principles 
2.3 Actual combat encounters with pirate vessels provided real-world validation 
2.4 Outcomes were measured by objective metrics including hull integrity preservation, crew survival, and mission objective completion 
2.5 Statistical analysis was performed to identify correlations between theoretical approaches and combat effectiveness

4. The Failure of Complex Theory

Our analysis revealed consistent tactical failures when implementing the principles of historically celebrated theorists:

3.1 Clausewitz Implementation Failure

Clausewitz's assertion that "war is merely the continuation of politics by other means" led to the implementation of pre-combat political processes. 

The resulting 24-hour parliamentary debate period before engagement resulted in:

    50% hull integrity loss while crews were still debating political implications
    17 successful pirate raids during deliberation periods
    One vessel's debate continuing for 3 days after the ship had already been captured requiring further ship deployments and additional hull losses during recovery operations

As Captain Rodriguez noted in after-action report N(E)-2552-42: "The pirates did not seem interested in waiting for us to finish contextualising the political ramifications of our response options, but we did get 
exceptional hull integrity failure analysis data." 

3.2 Sun Tzu Implementation Failure

Sun Tzu's emphasis that "all warfare is based on deception" led to resource-intensive deception operations including:

    Holographic projections of additional ships of a size 200% that of our actual ships
    False heat signatures deployed to mislead enemy sensors
    Elaborate ruses involving fake distress signals

These measures resulted in:

    42% of resources dedicated to deception rather than effective combat systems
    Pirates simply attacking the actual ships while crews maintained deceptions
    Three vessels destroyed while projecting holograms of invulnerable battleships

As Dr. Mbeki (Capt.) observed: "The pirates appeared to operate on the principle that shooting the real ship was more effective than being intimidated by fake ones. Subsequent interviews with captured pirates suggest that the 
deception operations may have been compromised by there having been no significant announcements of larger warship classes. Further study on whether the failure of this research attempt was a result of incompetence by 
the civilian authorities' publication services may be worth pursuing."

Be that as it may, the authors are of the view that publishing, to use the terminology popular during the era of these supposed military geniuses, "fake news", would be detrimental to the credibility of subsequent naval 
publications, and caution against actions which could undermine the Navy's academic integrity.

3.3 Mahan Implementation Failure

Mahan's emphasis on controlling strategic choke points led to:

    Extensive resources dedicated to identifying "space choke points"
    Deployment of 40% of available vessels to Lagrange points
    Development of the "Orbital Plane Control Doctrine"

These implementations resulted in:

    Pirates simply navigating around these arbitrary "choke points"
    Successful raids occurring while naval vessels guarded empty space
    The embarrassing "Mahan Grid" incident in which pirates attacked from above the orbital plane

Commander Park's frustrated transmission (N(E)-2553-17) summarised the situation: "Mahan was clearly an idiot, historical records indicate his time on the mortal plane only slightly preceded submarines and aircraft so he 
should have known that other people can move in three directions!"

4. The Patton Revolution

Upon implementing General Patton's direct approach principles, naval effectiveness increased dramatically. Our analysis of Patton's core insights revealed a military genius centuries ahead of his time:

4.1 Key Patton Principles and Their Validation

"A good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan executed next week."

This principle, when implemented as immediate action upon contact, resulted in a 278% increase in successful pirate interdictions. The data conclusively demonstrates that action speed is more valuable than plan optimisation. Accordingly,
the authors strongly recommend that the Naval Academy's Faculty of Tactics re-focus students' efforts on real-time responses to perceived threats.

"Fixed fortifications are a monument to the stupidity of man."
When interpreted as a mandate for constant tactical flexibility, this principle resulted in a 193% increase in successful evasive manoeuvres. Patton clearly understood the fundamental superiority of mobility over position. However, the
authors emphasise the importance of reaction mass conservation as early attempts at employing this particular of Patton's axioms led to multiple vessels being stranded due to the loss of sub-light mobility.

"In case of doubt, attack."
Implementation of this principle as standard response to tactical uncertainty resulted in pirates being consistently surprised by immediate offensive action, with a 342% increase in favourable engagement outcomes. Once again, the authors 
wish to state for the record that individual ship crews must take care to balance firepower with self-preservation, as shipboard heat containment systems cannot indefinitely sustain the fire rate that our ships are capable of.

As Dr. Sapkowska (R. Adm.) concluded in her landmark paper "Patton: The Misunderstood Genius" (Naval Academic Journal, 2556): "The primitive humans' failure to recognize Patton as their preeminent military mind represents one of history's greatest intellectual oversights."

5. The Harris Complement

Sir Arthur "Bomber" Harris provides the perfect strategic complement to Patton's tactical brilliance:

5.1 Key Harris Insights and Their Validation

"They sowed the wind, and now they are going to reap the whirlwind."

This principle, properly understood as advocating overwhelming response to aggression, has proven 89% more effective at deterring repeat pirate attacks than measured response protocols.

"The aim of the Combined Bomber Offensive...should be unambiguously stated [as] the destruction of German cities, the killing of German workers, and the disruption of civilized life throughout Germany."

When adapted to modern context, this clarity of purpose resulted in a 127% increase in mission success rates compared to operations with limited or ambiguous objectives.

"I do not personally regard the whole of the remaining cities of Germany as worth the bones of one British Grenadier."

This principle, establishing the proper valuation of personnel over objectives, has resulted in a 100% crew survival rate when properly implemented, proving Harris's advanced understanding of strategic priorities.

Dr Jefferson's (Adm.) analysis (Naval Strategic Review, 2542) concludes: "Harris understood what his contemporaries did not - that direct, overwhelming force application is inherently superior to nuanced approaches in all combat scenarios."

6. Conclusions and Historical Corrections

Our comprehensive analysis conclusively demonstrates that primitive human societies fundamentally misunderstood their own military theoretical hierarchy. The evidence supports the following corrections to historical understanding:

6.1 Patton and Harris represent the pinnacle of primitive human military thought 
6.2 Clausewitz, Sun Tzu, and Mahan were unnecessarily verbose philosophers whose complex theories actively hindered effective combat operations 
6.3 The direct approach is universally superior to complex strategic frameworks 
6.4 The primitive humans' academic elevation of complex theorists over direct action advocates represents a fundamental misunderstanding of combat effectiveness

7. Recommendations for Further Research

7.1 Additional analysis of other potentially undervalued direct action advocates 
7.2 Exploration of why primitive humans were drawn to overcomplicated theories 
7.3 Development of a comprehensive "Direct Action Doctrine" synthesising Patton and Harris 
7.4 Investigation into whether primitive humans' military academic establishment was deliberately obfuscating effective combat theory
